# Client_Hardware

A simple simulation of a server and client through hardware implementation


Learning Goal: I'm working on a electrical engineering question and need an explanation and answer to help me learn.

In this assignment, you and your lab partner need to design and set up two clients/computers from each side, and then communicate with each other via Broker using MQTT protocol. If you have a Raspberry PI board, please implement one client on Raspberry PI board. If you donâ€™t have the board, you can make your computer as a client.

Each team needs to submit one report (a single pdf file) only named TeamMemberNames_HW2. The following contents should be included in your report.

Draw a block diagram to show the relationship between Broker, and two clients (publisher/subscriber).
Make an instruction/menu to show all steps you did. (The principle rule: If others follow your steps, they should be able to reconstruct your result without any confusion or trouble. )
Include code in your report as well.The
Please don't copy the code from the internet.
Please do step by step I can do it on my computer.
